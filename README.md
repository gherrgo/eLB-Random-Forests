# eLB-Random-Forests
This repository contains scripts for the data preparation and Random Forest classifier constructions detailed within our manuscript "Detection of Diagnostic and Prognostic Methylation-based Signatures in Liquid Biopsy Specimens from Patients with Meningiomas". 
The included random forest algorithms: 
1. diagnostic Meningioma-epigenetic Liquid Biopsy (d-MeLB)
2. prognostic Meningioma-epigenetic Liquid Biopsy (p-MeLB)
